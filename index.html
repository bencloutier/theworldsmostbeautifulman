      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>2K12CR is about trying to make memorable/killer sounding music that's also fun and humorous. We aren't afraid
        to create an album that contains a mix of different genres. Songs we've created include Metal, R&B, Country,
        Indie, Rock, and Rap. 2K12CR currently has two official releases "Nothing 2 Lose" and "Very Good Bad Boys".</p>

      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>2K12CR was formed in Austin, Texas sometime in 2015 after Ben Cloutier's (aka Cloutier) 2014 release of This Is
        A Very Good Album Of Rap Music. After meeting guitarist David Menendez and realizing they had a similar sense of
        humor and appreciation for music, David was asked to collaborate on Cloutier's follow up album. They then
        decided to officially join forces to start 2K12CR (2012 Cloutier Records) for the 2016 release of Nothing 2
        Lose. Then in 2017 with the release of Very Good Bad Boys.</p>
      <p>After a hiatus 2K12CR is now back to making music in 2019 and looking forward to 2020 and beyond!</p>
